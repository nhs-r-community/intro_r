## Attending the course?

If you are attending the course all the course materials and preparation instructions are [here](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/collection/nhsr-intro/prework/).

## Are you wanting to update or use the slide code?

This repository is split into 3 areas:

* [RMarkdown files and dependency files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/main) - slides have been built in {xaringan} which requires the css, img and libs folder to render
* [html pages](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/gh-pages) - are automatically rendered using GitHub actions (no need to knit every file!) and are kept on a separate branch. The html files are published though GitHub [here](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/intro_r/) and being {xaringan} they are interactive and accessible
* [data files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/tree/26a2e39bd49d4aa95a8efc5b45c398386e6e4ed4) are in a separate repository to help learners access the data files separate to the code for the slides

r <- desc::desc_get_remotes()

cat(
  "``` r",
  paste0(
    "install.packages(",
    paste("\"", p[!p %in% str_extract(r, "(?<=/).*$")], "\"", collapse = ", ", sep = ""),
    ")\n",
