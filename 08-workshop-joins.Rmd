# Relational data

It's rare to find all the data you need for an analysis in a single table.

</br> Typically, you'll have to link two (or more) tables together by matching on common "key" variable(s).

.green[We use joins in SQL or R, VLOOKUPs in Excel]

---

# Relational data

Here, we'll focus on left (outer) joins.

</br> The syntax is similar for other types of joins.

---

# left_join()

Keep structure of table x

…and match to observations in table y

"key" variable (common to both tables)

```{r}
x %>% 
  left_join(y, by = "id")
```

# Relational Data

We're going to join two tables one with cases of tuberculosis by country, one with population by country.

</br> From this new table we could derive a rate.

class: center, middle

# Please Import

.blue[tb_cases.csv]

.blue[tb_pop.csv]

and

.blue[tb_new_table.csv]

---

# left_join

Keep the original structure of the tb_cases data frame

…then match to rows in tb_pop

based on "country" value

```{r population}
tb_cases %>% 
  left_join(tb_pop, by = "country")
```

---

# Duplicates!

For every country value in tb_cases, there are 4 in tb_pop

```{r ref.label="population", echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

```

---

# Join on multiple rows

match on two (or more) variables

```{r }
tb_cases %>% 
  left_join(tb_pop, by = c("country", "year"))
```

--

</br>

### You may recall from an earlier slide

You can create a vector with function: c() for concatenate/combine

```{r}
c(100, 80, 200)

c("beds", "staff", "patients")
```

---

# Default combine

Dplyr join verbs find the same named columns and list in the output what it has joined on ## Joining, by = c("country", "year")

This can be copied from the console

```{r eval=TRUE}
tb_cases %>% 
  left_join(tb_pop)
```

---

# Joining with different names

If two tables have .blue[different] names for .blue[same] variable:

```{r}
tb_cases %>% 
  left_join(tb_new_table, by = c("country" = "Place",
                              "year" = "Yr"))
```

tb_new_table is the same table as tb_cases but with a column Joined.

---

# Other joins

Like SQL, dplyr has left_join, inner_join and full_join. 

Joins that are slightly different to SQL are:

--

### [Semi-join](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42249690/what-is-semi-join-in-database)

All rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. 

<img class="center" src="img/session08/semi-join.gif" width="40%"/>

---

# Use Case

Finding hospital patients who have had a Covid-19 test but only bring back the information on the hospital, nothing about the test.

Join to the tb_new_table and bring back only those records where the column FirstLetter is 'A' but nothing from tb_new_table.

```{r eval=TRUE}

tb_cases %>% 
  semi_join(tb_new_table %>% 
              filter(FirstLetter == "A"), by = c("country" = "Place",
                              "year" = "Yr"))

```


---

### [Anti-join](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28702960/find-complement-of-a-data-frame-anti-join)

All rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.

<img class="center" src="img/session08/anti-join.gif" width="40%"/>

---

# Use Case

In text mining, exclude 'stop words' (but, and, or) which are kept in a separate table for reference.

Join to the tb_new_table and exclude only those records where the column FirstLetter is 'A' .

```{r eval=TRUE}

tb_cases %>% 
  anti_join(tb_new_table %>% 
              filter(FirstLetter == "A"), by = c("country" = "Place",
                              "year" = "Yr"))

```
